% If you want to automatically open the previous project when you startup
% MATLAB, then add the following command at the end of your 'startup.m'
% file. Or you can rename this file to 'startup.m' and copy into one of
% your search path (like the directory where 'pm.m' is in).

pm('startup_pm');
